stick around , please ?
she 's coming .
well done , sire !
what is going on here , man ?
i 'll catch you up . don 't worry ; he 's expecting you .
knowing larry , he probably missed the flight .
nothing ... let 's get crazy !
yeah . that 's just the story i tell the girls to get them into bed . truth is ... i don 't know . the whole honor and duty thing . make a difference in the world , crap like that . didn 't really work out .
it 's rude to talk about religion . you never know who you 're going to offend .
i don 't know . i really don 't know .
mom , meet jango .
jack , you 're not the usual type we get here .
in here .
the line was busy . i 'll try again .
i 'm in my party mood .
well , i 've just been able to get off that norway coast - so far .
they decreed me a savage , and now they have made me one .
no , baby . he wants me .
pussy-willows , dottie !
ann bishop millaney .
i don 't know . casual but nice . they think you 're a writer .
no , ma'am .
yes .
don 't be callous .
he was killed .
holidays are our busiest days . no one likes to be alone on holidays . i know i don 't .
looking for something -- someone .
that sounds like horseshit .
not possible .
yeah . just grazed me . the professor 's under the floor too ... with the overthruster ...
... .i don 't know .
you , too . kick ass today .
tonight .
oh , yeah ... probably ...
yes ! i 've dreamed of it for years , but your movie made me realize i 've got to take action . goodbye , penis !
i 'm the matron 's favourite patient and she 's shown me her special stitch !
don 't worry , gina ! mummy and daddy love each other .
that 's okay . i love you anyway .
if this is someone 's idea of a joke --
sure i know where he lives . he lives in bailey park .
you 're a beautiful big animal .
this is a legitimate cinematic genre . just like westerns , comedies , film noire , science fiction ...
are you sure ?
oh , jesus ! !
no shit .
yeah . naturally vain -- but they 're about to close the betting table and i haven 't a sou..
always .
he takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit , cuts his fingertip , takes my hand , does the same to me ...
i thought i felt mean tonight . but i 'm not i 'm just all mixed up ... .
yes .
sure thing , and --
uh-uh .
we get together sometimes .
a man tripped and fell on a chainsaw . we got three of his fingers back on .
oh really ? starbucks ?
okay . but not water sports .
me get heap firewater --
bring out our spearmen and set them in the field .
my mom packed for me . i think she sent everything i ever owned . so we 'll see .
yeah , you do that , lenny .
you 're a fat hypocrite . you don 't feel any sorrier for ugarte than i do .
stay where you are . i don 't know what you 're talking about .
*homer* liked it ! didn 't you ?
no trouble .
right ... right .
amazing you made it this far .
why ? then they 'll notice when i 'm gone . well . i 'm making a public appearance aren 't i ?
oh .
whoever took it does .
in his inside coat pocket .
the party ?
and you thought they might be under her dress ?
the game was to make me smaller than he was . no matter what . he could be almost invisible as a human being , but i had to be smaller . so if i got good grades , i was a pussy for not playing football . if i cut my hair for him , it wasn 't short enough . if i shaved it , i looked like a psycho . i never won the game . not once . and if he couldn 't make me smaller with words ...
sooner than the fall .
must of got a little too frisky with the pharaoh 's daughter .
to kill your wife .
i can 't go out there . how can i go out there ?
i think you have a call ?
never .
if ... ?
nice . maybe you 'll stop by ... have an aperitif ...
animal ! animal ! aren 't you ashamed of yourself ? a couple of guys are trying to escape and you 're thinking of broads . broads ?
okay then , you 're crazy .
that 's a good boy , toddy .
i 'll look in here again .
every morning .
perhaps you 'll want to consult that ouija board again .
we hate you guys !
i 've lost you . you 're gone . i can 't hear anything .
i 'm making my turn . i see the school up ahead .
ask them .
from here on , i dish it out .
we can 't and he knows it .
insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us .
just eat whatever you want . this will give you a chance to meet some people .
anything interesting .
then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can 't say anything .
so everything he told me yesterday was a lie . everything .
sure . i only sound like forty-year- old in your language .
what ?
